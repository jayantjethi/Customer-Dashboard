# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Customer-Dashboard
This a Project Regarding Customer Dashboard which has enabled various features like sorting,searching etc in the React Framework.
In This Project I have Implemented Several Features like Sorting by id,name and city i.e. when you click on the above paramteres then sorting occurs in 
ascending and descending order and vice versa. Also I have used searching feature here which is case insensitive and it matches each parameter you type
with the table entry and gives you the "name" which is matched with the value entered. Also I have given a button down below which on clicks gives you the 
total number of id's or names present in our API.
Also All these works are done on the API and properties were fetched according.
I have Used React as my framework.

How to run project locally?
I have provided you the github link you can extract files and open vscode for the same.
After that open terminal in vscode by click - " ctrl + shift + ` " and then if you inside your working folder then just write - "npm start".
Else if you want to come within your folden then "cd folder_name".
Using these commands your project will open in some localhost and you can acess it accordingly.

# Customer-Dashboard
This a Project Regarding Customer Dashboard which has enabled various features like sorting,searching etc in the React Framework.
In This Project I have Implemented Several Features like Sorting by id,name and city i.e. when you click on the above paramteres then sorting occurs in 
ascending and descending order and vice versa. Also I have used searching feature here which is case insensitive and it matches each parameter you type
with the table entry and gives you the "name" which is matched with the value entered. Also I have given a button down below which on clicks gives you the 
total number of id's or names present in our API.
Also All these works are done on the API and properties were fetched according.
I have Used React as my framework.

How to run project locally?
I have provided you the github link you can extract files and open vscode for the same.
After that open terminal in vscode by click - " ctrl + shift + ` " and then if you inside your working folder then just write - "npm start".
Else if you want to come within your folden then "cd folder_name".
Using these commands your project will open in some localhost and you can acess it accordingly.
